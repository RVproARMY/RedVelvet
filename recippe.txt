I used to be unsure about red velvet. I don’t really trust a cake that has a mystery flavor. What is red velvet? Is it vanilla, chocolate, or just a butter cake tinted red? From red velvet brownies and red velvet cookies and red velvet cupcakes, I’ve had a lot of fun getting to know red velvet. Red velvet is:

1) Mild cocoa flavor
2) Tangy buttermilk
3) Sweet vanilla
4) Very buttery

These 4 flavors are essential to the perfect red velvet layer cake. Not only is the flavor outstanding,
red velvet cake’s texture is worth writing home about.
It’s dense and soft with a moist and velvety crumb.
However, the absolute best part about red velvet cake is the cream cheese frosting. 
Slathered on thick, my cream cheese frosting recipe is delicately sweet and undeniably creamy.

Cake Flour: I highly recommend that you use cake flour. Cake flour is much lighter than all-purpose and the
perfect base for a light, soft-crumbed cake texture.
Like I mention above, red velvet’s texture is important to the authenticity of the flavor.
You will thank me for the recommendation after you taste how incredibly soft this cake is! 
It’s the texture you find at professional bakeries. If you can’t get your hands on cake flour, 
you can make a DIY cake flour substitute.
Unsweetened Cocoa Powder: 2 Tablespoons is plenty for a little cocoa flavor without overpowering the vanilla and butter flavors.

Butter & Oil: What sets red velvet cake apart from chocolate is its buttery flavor. With only butter, we risk a dry cake. With only oil, we lose the butter flavor and softness that comes with creaming butter & sugar together. So all that’s to say, use both butter and oil. Moist texture, soft and cakey texture, buttery flavor. Boom.
Buttermilk: Buttermilk is tangy, creamy, and makes baked goods

extremely moist. You can’t make delicious red velvet cake without it! Additionally, buttermilk helps activate the baking soda to leaven the cake
